This project demonstrates three essential data visualization techniques using Pythonâ€™s matplotlib and seaborn libraries, each designed to analyze and interpret different datasets effectively. The first visualization is a line plot that tracks the population growth of four cities from 2010 to 2016. Each city is represented by a separate line, making it easy to compare trends and observe growth patterns over time. The second visualization is a scatter plot that examines the relationship between hours studied and test scores. By plotting individual data points, this chart helps identify potential correlations and trends in student performance based on study time. The third visualization is a bar chart representing total sales for each month of the year. This chart provides a clear overview of monthly sales performance, highlighting peak sales months and potential seasonal variations. Together, these visualizations serve as powerful tools for analyzing real-world data, making them valuable for insights and decision-making.
